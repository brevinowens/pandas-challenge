### Obversations from analysis: 

#### 1: My first observation from the dataset which was a bit curious was that as school funding increased, the greater amount budgeted per student, the percent of students that passed went down. This is interesting as you would think that as funding increased, scores would be higher due to additional resources. However, the funding is not clear as to what the money went towards so perhaps the money was going to other things such as extra curriculars and sports. 

#### 2: Another observation that I noticed is that charter schools outperform district schools substantially. This is to be somewhat expected, but our data shows that relationship clearly.
